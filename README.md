# Design decisions

#### The light and dark themes in the crypto tracker were implemented to provide flexibility and user convenience. By offering a choice between light and dark themes, I aimed to cater to individual preferences in terms of visual appearance and comfort while using the application.
#### The light theme creates a sense of freshness, cleanliness, and spaciousness, which can be appealing to users who prefer a bright and light color palette. It can also help reduce eye strain in bright lighting conditions.
#### On the other hand, the dark theme creates an atmosphere of mystery and elegance. It may be more comfortable to use in low lighting conditions or for users who prefer a subdued and deep color scheme.
#### By offering the option to switch between light and dark themes, I aimed to meet diverse needs and preferences, allowing users to customize the application to their own style and preferences.
